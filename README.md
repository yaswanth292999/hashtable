A low-level implementation of a generic hash table in C using open addressing with linear probing, supporting dynamic resizing, custom hash functions, and key/value cleanup callbacks.
Designed to illustrate how modern hash maps (like those in Python, Go, or Java) manage collisions and memory at a system level.
